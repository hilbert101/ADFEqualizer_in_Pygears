Decision-Feedback Equalizers (DFE) have been widely used in mm-wave communication systems to reduce intersymbol interference (ISI) effect to improve quality of received signal and achieve a data rate of Gbps level. In this project, we developed a high throughput adaptive DFE in PyGears. The LMS algorithm is applied to create a new set of coefficients to feed-foreward and feedback filter every cycle, and thus finds the minimum mean square error (MMSE) iteratively. To reduce the critical path and accommodate high speed throughput, we use a relaxed version of the LMS algorithm that adds extra latency at the output of the adapted coefficient, allowing the retiming to be applied on the adaptive DFE architecture. In particular, to also limit the increase of fanout in each stage, we retime every other register in the feedforward and feedback filters, resulting in a modified filter architecture with a staggered placement of registers. Further improvements were explored such as look up tables, Wallace reduction, and more retiming in both feedforward path and feedback loop. The optimized result improves the maximum clock rate from 400 MHz to 900 MHz. With PAM4 modulation, the implemented adaptive DFE achieves a data rate of 1.8 Gbps, which has great potential to support the high data-rate (Gbps) applications.
